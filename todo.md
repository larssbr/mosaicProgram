## List of things to do

- change argument parser
--> maybe make -i 'is_infofile' similar to -showmatches argument 

--> to work with mosaicCreate() method

- make functions do only one thing, not multiple things -- SOME DONE

- make a mind map of program flow -- DONE

- Make bigger initial container. to fitt the whole mosaic, -- 
--> or expand for each time a new picture is added

--> Rectification of images
Rectification is the process of transforming the input image into
an output image with the distortion corrected, and optionally transformed 
by rotation, in-plane translation, and scale.

--> Mosaic frame
In the case the mosaic dimensions exceeds
a pre-set limit, images and relative transformation matrices, 
are re-sampled and the resulting mosaic size is computed again.
